# AngularTutorial
### A simple e-commerce web app with catalog, shopping cart, and check-out form that covers the basics of Angular framework. This introductive tutorial is from the [official Angular page](https://angular.io/start)

## Topics covered
- **Structural directives** Shape or reshape the DOM's structure, by adding, removing, and manipulating elements (*\*ngFor, \*ngIf..*)
- **Interpolation** Converts elements properties to text to be used (*{{ product.name }}*)
- **Property Binding** Permits to use a element property value in a template expression (*[title]= "product.name"*)
- **Event Binding** Permits to call a event directly from the template (*(click)= "buy()"*)
- **Input and Output Decorators** Allow data transference between parent and child components
- **Routing using angular Router**
- **Http requests**
